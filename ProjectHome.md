Prolog Cafe is a Prolog-to-Java source-to-source translator system. Prolog programs are first translated into Java programs via the WAM (Warren Abstract Machine), and then those programs are compiled by a usual Java compiler such as SUN's JDK SE.

This project is a fork of 1.2.5 from http://kaminari.scitec.kobe-u.ac.jp/prologcafe/.
